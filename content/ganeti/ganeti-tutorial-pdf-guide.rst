As I mentioned in my previous blog post, trying out Ganeti can be cumbersome and
I went out and created a platform for testing it out using Vagrant. Now I have a
`PDF guide`_ that you can use to walk through some of the basics steps of using
Ganeti along with even testing a fail-over scenario. Its an updated version of a
guide I wrote for OSCON last year. Give it a try and let me know what you think!
