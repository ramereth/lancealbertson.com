Beer and Blog at `Fireworks`_ was awesome tonight! Thanks so much to Ocean for
getting the pizza's lined up for us. It never ceases to amaze me about the tech
community here in Corvallis. It may be smaller than Portland, but its certainly
just as full of energy and ideas!

Tonight I overheard some discussions about getting other user groups going on a
more regular basis centered around ideas created at Beer and Blog. I'm excited
to hear new ideas like this coming out of these meet ups. It was certainly one
of the goals and hopes I had when I decided to organize. Related to that, I'm
planning on heading up to Portland on Saturday and help at the `Calagator code
sprint`_. While I don't plan on helping with much coding, I do hope to get some
feedback on some usability questions I had regarding a Corvallis Calagator based
site I was working on. The Corvallis tech community is facing the same problems
Portland had, but on a much smaller scale. There's getting to be more and more
events happening and people need an easy way to track it.

I'm actually hoping to utilize Calagator as more of a community driven calendar
that includes events such as live music, arts events, and other community
related events. While I'm personally interested in a unified live music
calendar, I'd love to see it used for a more wide range of events.

But back to Beer 'n Blog tonight! It almost turned into a disaster for me
tonight. I had just gotten to Fireworks when my pager started going off in a
frenzy. By the end of it, my iPhone had about 100 text messages on it. I soon
noticed that a group of servers in a set of racks next to each other appeared to
have a power failure of some kind. Thankfully one of my students was still at
work and took care of it. Almost everything came back online without any help
from us which is amazing. I'm still waiting on the full story on what happened
but it appears one of the electricians working on the power upgrade had tripped
something on the power rail those servers were on. Talk about a headache! :(

Even though we didn't have a real "topic" driven session tonight, I think a lot
of people got help with their blogs and learned a few new tricks! Next week
we'll have `Dawn Foster`_ from Portland at Cloud 9 for a talk about Yahoo Pipes.
I can't wait!
