I'm going to be speaking at several open source conferences this summer.  Most
of my talks will be centered around a virtualization management tool called
`Ganeti`_. I plan to write several blog posts in the coming weeks going over
Ganeti in preparation to my talk at `Open Source Bridge`_.

Here's the `list of conferences`_ I will be speaking at:

Let me know if you will be attending any of these conferences so we can hang
out!
