I'm going to be speaking at `SCALE 9x`_ this year and giving a session on
`Scalable Virtualization with Ganeti`_ on Saturday February 26th at 6pm. I will
be going over the basics of what `Ganeti`_ is and how you use it. This session
will be very similar to the ones I gave last year at `Open Source Bridge`_ and
`LinuxCon Boston`_.

If you want to meet me in person and talk about what's going on at the `Open
Source Lab`_, `Supercell`_, Ganeti,Gentoo, or just other random stuff, feel free
to! I'll be the only person coming from the OSUOSL but I'll be sure to represent
us the best that I can.

See you at SCALE9x in a few weeks!
