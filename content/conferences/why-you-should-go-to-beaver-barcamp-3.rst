`Beaver BarCamp`_ is tomorrow in Corvallis and you should go to it! Why?

-  Its completely free and open to EVERYONE
-  Free food and drinks!
-  You get a free T-Shirt (if you `register`_)
-  Cool and interesting `topics & ideas`_ will be discussed!
-  Meet other cool people from the area

But what is a `BarCamp`_ exactly?

    BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to
    share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with
    discussions, demos and interaction from participants who are the
    main actors of the event. -- `barcamp.org`_

This is the third incarnation of Beaver BarCamp in Corvallis and is bound to be
the largest thus far. Many people I have talked to have a hard time
understanding what happens at a barcamp, and if its only for technical people.
In the past, our barcamp has been tech focused, but that's been primarily
because the outreach for the event has been mostly directed at OSU EECS
students. Barcamp's are designed so that the people who attend **also** are the
presenters. The more people who attend, the more variety you'll have at the
event. You don't need to have a full-fledge presentation prepared, just an
idea, a room (which we'll provide), and people to talk to!

How do you give a session? Make sure you get to Kelly Engineering at 10AM, put
your presentation and name on a sticky note, pick a room & time and stick the
wall. We'll adjust rooms based on the popularity of the session to ensure there
is enough room. We have all of the meeting and classrooms available in Kelly
essentially, so we shouldn't have any problems finding a room! Food and drinks
will be provided for free thanks to the sponsorship of the `OSEL`_ for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We'll also have a snack break in the afternoon!

Some fun non-technical examples you could see at a BarCamp:

-  How to kayake
-  How to brew beer
-  How to grow chickens in your backyard

Don't feel like giving a session yourself? That's OK! We won't pressure you at
all. You can come and attend just one session to see what its like and don't
need to spend all day there.

I plan on giving sessions about the following tomorrow:

-  What is `Calagator`_ and why Corvallis needs it
-  What's the next step for the Corvallis Social Tech scene?
-  `Ignite Corvallis`_ brainstorm / roundtable discussion

I hope to see you there tomorrow!
