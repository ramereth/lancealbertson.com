That's right, come see my musical talents next Tuesday night from 6:30 - 8PM at
`Charlies Rhythm and Brews`_ in Albany, Oregon. This will be our first gig ever
as a group! We've been working hard since last September or so working out a set
and we're finally ready for the big scene. The group I'm in is jazz combo called
`The Infallible Collective`_. The group details are as such:

-  **Trumpet** - Me!
-  **Electric Upright Bass** - W.G. 'Malkiel' Davies
-  **Guitar** - Doug Meyers
-  **Drums** - Kevin Van Walk

We'll be playing a mixture of jazz standards (with a twist!) along with some
originals compositions by the group. The style of Jazz we'll be playing will
range from 50s & 60s bop to Latin Swing & Bossa Nova to modern trip-hop and
jams. It should be a good time! I'll be posting a Facebook event about it soon.

See you there!
