As some of you may have noticed, I usually carry around a tiny little black
laptop when I'm at `Beer and Blog`_ or at a coffee shop. Since people ask about
it so much, I decided to write a few blog posts about it with this being the
first.

What is it? Its an `EeePC 1000`_ from `ASUS`_ (the same guys that make
motherboards). Its a new type of laptop that is generally referred to as a
`netbook`_ mainly because it lacks some of the features that a normal
laptop has such as a cdrom, being heavy, a multi-core power sucking CPU, and a
huge screen. Outside of that, its like any other laptop with a few other
enhancements. In my case, this EeePC has these features which I love about it.

-  Long battery life, claims one day computing (6+hrs)
-  Solid State Drives (`SSD`_) - no moving parts & better battery life!
-  Multi-touch track pad
-  Very usable keyboard (92% from a normal laptop)
-  Lightweight (2lbs 15oz)
-  Fast 1.6 Ghz Intel Atom processor
-  802.11n Wi-Fi and Blue-tooth
-  1.3MP web cam

I've used my trusty 15" PowerBook for many years and I still use it, but its
become more of a hassle to carry around with me. I'm a UNIX Admin, so I don't
need much on my laptop (xterm, Firefox, Thunderbird, and pidgin) to get work
done and the EeePC was a perfect fit. The `first models`_ that ASUS releases for
the EeePC didn't appeal to me since they had a screen and keyboard that was too
small for me to deal with. A good friend of mine (who also has the habit of
being an enabler for me :P) purchased one for himself and kept raging about it.
I was actually considering getting an upgrade for my PowerBook but didn't want
to pay $2K for a new MacBook, so instead I decided to get this EeePC for√Ç around
$500 (its down to $430 now).

Asus gives you two options for Operating Systems on these laptops: Windows XP or
Linux (`Xandros`_). Since I'm a `Gentoo`_ developer, I decided to give it a try
on this laptop. I encountered a few issues of course, but overall I have all the
hardware working. The only annoying thing so far is the wireless driver not
being included in the mainline kernel, but that's going to change soon I hope.
There is an open source driver but its a little finicky to deal with on networks
using any form of security passwords. But it **does** work!

In the upcoming posts, I plan to write about the following:

-  How I installed Gentoo on it
-  Gentoo tweaks I use on it
-  Window management
-  Firefox tweaks (yes, you need them!)
-  How netbooks are helping promote Linux to the masses

I love my EeePC and you should get one too! :)
